Hello! Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student in the Computer Sciences department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sharon Yixuan Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/). Previously, I completed my MS degree at Yonsei University in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department under the supervision of Prof. [Kwanghoon Sohn](https://diml.yonsei.ac.kr/) and Prof. [Kibok Lee](https://ml.yonsei.ac.kr/).

I am broadly interested in **safe and reliable machine learning** that align with human intentions and values. Currently, my research focuses on the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
