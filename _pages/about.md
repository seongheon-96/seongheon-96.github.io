Hello! Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in the Computer Sciences department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sharon Yixuan Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QSTd1oUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Previously, I completed my MS degree at Yonsei University in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department under the supervision of Prof. [Kwanghoon Sohn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEtk0QsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Kibok Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6wwWRdEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie broadly in **safe and reliable foundation models**, with a current focus on large language models, multi-modal language models, and diffusion models. By "reliable," I mean developing methods that help users better trust model outputs. Specifically, my work centers on:

* Detecting and mitigating hallucinations and errors
* Uncertainty quantification
* Interpretability

I am also interested in applying these techniques to broader challenges, including the design of more accurate reward and training signals for post-training and self-improvement.
