Hello! Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Sciences department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sharon Yixuan Li](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/). I completed my M.S. degree at Yonsei University in the Electronic and Electrical Engineering department under the supervision of Prof. [Kwanghoon Sohn](https://diml.yonsei.ac.kr/) and Prof. [Kibok Lee](https://ml.yonsei.ac.kr/).

My research vision centers on aligning AI systems with human intentions and values, specifically by developing safe and reliable AI models that are robust to distribution shifts in real-world environments. Currently, I am focusing on the safety of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal language models (MLLMs).
